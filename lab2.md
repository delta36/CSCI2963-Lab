##Lab 2

###Question 1
It is important to choose a license in order to properly determine the direction you want community development around your software to go. It is also important to license your code so that you can be protected under the law in case someone or a group infringes on your code and tries to redistribute it for their own profit or for other reasons. 

###Question 2
It is important not to work on code without a license because the owner could at any time choose to apply a license which could lock you and/or the community out of development of the software, or otherwise enable the owner to redistribute or manipulate the software in ways which the development community does not agree to. In short, unlicensed code has no guarantee to remain open in the future.

###Question 3
I agree with the overall claim. In general, with something which would become as vastly used and accessed by users, an open source environment is important in order to encourage rapid and sustained development. By being closed, Gopher alienated their userbase and simultaneously closed off any opportunities for rapid growth via contribution from the user base. As a result, forks in the user base were catasrophic, as there ultimately was not enough development for the main branch of Gopher.

###Question 4
Android uses the permissive Apache 2.0 license. It does this since google is aiming to gain a wide berth of the market share for mobile markets, so it makes sense to offer up their OS as open source so that it is adopted faster and spreads faster among both corporations looking to develop a comercial product and small-time enthusiasts looking to build their own mobile platforms or services.

###Question 5
For my example theoretical project I chose to make a game project which would be built with modability in mind so that other developers could easily improve or make their own different versions of the game, based off of any distribution of the game. For this reason I chose GNU public 3.0 license, because it would allow for anyone to reuse the source code for any reason, but they would have to release their source code afterwords so that others could use the code as an inspiration or springboard into their own release for the game. In this way, I would hope to incubate a robust and vibrant development environment around a series of simillar games so that the game as a whole could grow rapidly and in a wide variety of ways. This project structure would act much like the game pixel dungeon and its derivatives on android. 

###Question 6

^ Link to example repository with license.

###Question 7
For my project the ideal license would probably be the MIT license. This is because the apps I want to code will probably be simmple in nature, so there is no real need to strongly protect the code, and people could potentially use the code as a jumping off point for their own. There would be no real point to picking a license such as GNU, seeing as the code would probably be simple enough that most people would already be able to come up with it anyways, and that type of license would be way too much hassle for the type of code that would be accessed/edited. The license would be simple and to the point. It would allow for the a high degree of access from the outside for relatively little effort while still being open source.
