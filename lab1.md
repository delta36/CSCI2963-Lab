###Reading Reflections
The criteria of Open Source was clearly well thought out to account for a variety of different situations. The definition is quite hollistic and encompasing. Free culture was an interesting read, and its ideas are certainly very compelling, if not a little idealistic and lofty in its goals. The Smart Questions article I found very off-putting because the author seemed very full of himself, and not very considerate of others. Sure, someone may ask a question that isn't well thought out, or well placed, but the author's reaction seems to be to advocate for the normalization of straight up rude and nonconstructive behavior, which I cannot condone. My suggestions for helpful questions is actually to suggest that even if someone submits a seemingly dumb or not well thought out question to respond to them since they are taking the time to write a question so they at least have some interest in the project. Even if you feel that they haven't fully thought out or researched their question beforehand, point that out to them and try to point them in the right direction to find an answer on their own, don't just stonewall them or write "RTFM". It's extremely presumptuous and it's purposefully rude and even a little bit elitist.
