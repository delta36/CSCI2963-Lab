###Reading Reflections
The criteria of Open Source was clearly well thought out to account for a variety of different situations. The definition is quite hollistic and encompasing. The Smart Questions article I found very off-putting because the author seemed very full of himself, and not very considerate of others. Sure, someone may ask a question that isn't well thought out, or well placed, but the author's reaction seems to be to advocate for the normalization of straight up rude and nonconstructive behavior, which I cannot condone. My suggestions for helpful questions is actually to suggest that even if someone submits a seemingly dumb or not well thought out question to respond to them since they are taking the time to write a question so they at least have some interest in the project. Even if you feel that they haven't fully thought out or researched their question beforehand, point that out to them and try to point them in the right direction to find an answer on their own, don't just stonewall them or write "RTFM". It's extremely presumptuous and it's purposefully rude and even a little bit elitist.

Regarding chapter 3 of free culture, it is extremely disheartening yet not surprising to see that the RIAA and other large conglomerates are willing to leverage their vast amounts of money against specific individuals like Jessie just to try to set an example and scare off others, especially considering Jessie is clearly not responsible for the said acts of piracy. The RIAA would likely be better off trying to target piracy in other ways, such as improving the quality and convenience of their existing means of distribution, so that purchasing music through legitimate means is both more enticing and accessible than through piracy streams. What they are currently trying to do is fight an unwinnable and never ending battle and ignoring any potential collateral damage done to people like Jessie in the process, and further alienating groups of people who would probably otherwise be paying customers. There is definitely a case to be made that if the record industry wasn't so riddiculously overzealous and overbearing, everyone would be better off.

###Project 
For my potential project, I have some interest in app development for mobile platforms like Android. I have taken iOS coding classes in high school in the past, and the entire prospect seems quite interesting and engaging. It is a skill which I believe is extremely versatile and far-reaching in today's user environment considering a huge percentage of consumer computing devices are now smartphones, tablets, and otherwise handheld devices. In order to get experience I will most likely be writing some small and simple android apps for my phone. Once I get more comfortable with the development environment and process, I may turn my attention to larger projects, or even try to help to contribute to a current project, depending on if I can find a good project to contribute to. I may potentially return to explore iOS a little bit too, however, considering I do not own any iOS devices this seems to be more of a long term goal.
